# Stua

Stua is a little scripting language that largely rips off Lua. In
fact you probably should just use Lua instead. Nevertheless, Stua
is available if you use <a href="http://nothings.org/stb.h">stb.h</a>
by globally setting the #define `STB_STUA`.

## Why a brand new scripting language?

Why does Stua exist, especially in the face of Lua?

Stua's primary _raison d'\&ecirc;tre_ is
simply because it is included in the library stb.h, so it
is available with no effort to any application that uses
stb.h (which, for its author, is every application).
It also in the public domain so no attention need be
spent on placing copyright notices anywhere.

Of course this comes at a cost: all applications are
bogged down by this implementation of Stua. However, it is
not compiled into applications by default, and it uses a
fairly small amount of source code (about 1200 lines, or
about 15% of stb.h). The implementation is very small because
it builds on features available in stb.h (like generic hash
tables and lex-like regular-expression support), and
because it is _extremely_ inefficient. (Someday a better
implementation will be written to the exact same API; so
you can use the stb.h Stua implementation until the performance
becomes an issue, then drop in the better one.)

## Language overview

Some sample Stua code:

   // compute the x'th most fibonacci number recursively
   func fib(x)
      if x < 3 then
         1
      else
         fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)
      end
   end
      /* Note that there is no explicit 'return'; if you do not explicitly
       * return a value, then the value of a function is the value of its
       * last statement.
       */

   var x = print(fib(20))


### Identifiers

Stua identifier syntax is identical to C: an identifier begins
with an alphabetic character or an underscore, and continues
with 0 or more alphabetic characters, digits, and underscores.

### Simple data types

Stua supports a number of simple data types.

> *Numbers*:  30-bit integers, 31-bit floats. Defined in code like C. \
> *Strings*:  Defined in code like C, or with single quotes.  \
> *Booleans*: `true` and `false` are special value of their own type  \
> *Nil*: the value `nil` is a special 'out of band' value like NULL in C

Character constants are specified as in C, but prefixed with the
letter c, e.g. `c'x'\ ` or `c'\\n'`.

### Dictionaries

Stua has a single container type used for multiple purposes. It is
a dictionary mapping any data item (key) to any other data item (value).
Each key can only appear once in each dictionary.

You can create a dictionary in code in several ways.

    x = { foo=17, bar="hello" }
    y = { "foo", "bar", x, { a="b", c="d" } }
    z = { }
    w = { x=x }

In the above code, `x` will receive a newly-created dictionary which
maps the string "foo" to the integer 17 and the string "bar" to the
string "hello".

Because the dictionary stored in `y` does not specify the keys
explicitly, the values are assigned increasing integers starting
from 0, so y will receive the dictionary with the following mappings:

> key = 0; value = "foo" \
> key = 1; value = "bar" \
> key = 2; value = x, the dictionary listed above \
> key = 3; value = the dictionary ``{``\<"a",``"b">,``<"c",``"d">``}

The variable z receives an empty dictionary, and the variable `w`
receives a dictionary mapping the string "x" to the dictionary
referenced by the value of `x`. Note that further assignments to
the variable `x` will not change the dictionaries referenced in `y`
and `w`, but changes _to_ the dictionary `x` will be visible.

Dictionaries can be used for multiple purposes. They can take the
place of arrays (simply using integers to index them), they can
take the place of structures (storing values with string keys),
and they can be used as general purpose hash tables.

Dictionaries are referenced by using array-access notation:

   print(y[0])
   y[1] = x["foo"]
   z["bar"] = 1

You can also use a structure field access notation; the last line
above could also be represented as `z.bar=1`.

### Statements

Stua supports several types of statements. All statements
can be terminated with an optional ";". All statements
produce values, and the value of a function is the value
of its last statement.

   return [EXPRESSION]

This ends a function prematurely, and produces the optional
as the result, or `nil` if none is provided.

   if CONDITION then STATEMENTS [else STATEMENTS] end

The `else``STATEMENTS` part is optional. This computes the
obvious thing. The value of the `if` statement is the value
of the chosen branch. If `else` is omitted the value in the
`false` case is `nil`.

   while CONDITION [update STATEMENTS] do STATEMENTS end

The `update``STATEMENTS` part is optional. This repeatedly
tests `CONDITION`, and if it's true, executes the `do``STATEMENTS`
section. After executing the `do` section, the `update` section
is executed. Then the process repeats. The value computed is
the value of the last statement in the `do` section, or `nil`
if the loop never executes.

   break [EXPRESSION]

This terminates a loop prematurely. If the optional expression
is included, that value is the result of the loop.

   continue

This causes the current iteration of the to stop; the `update`
section is then executed, if present, and then the loop repeats
from the beginning.

<s>
   for VAR [,VAR] in EXPR do STATEMENTS end

The `for` construction iterates over the keys or \<key,``value>``pairs
of a dictionary. Note that if the dictionary changes during the
iteration, those changes will not be visible to the iterator. Thus
some pairs produced may not actually be in the dictionary.

Results computed, and behavior of `continue` and `break`, are
like `while`-`do`.</s> _Not implemented yet._

   => LVALUE

The *into* statement `=> x` takes the value computed by the
preceding statement and stores it to the lvalue on the right
side. The right side must be an identifier, array-access, or
structure-access. The idea here is that you can use an `if-then-else`
or `while` to compute a value and store it into a variable.
You can do this in a more normal way, but this way is possibly
clearer (it's an experimental design).

### Expressions

Stua supports all of the basic (non-assignment) C operators:

   + - * /              arithmetic operators
   << >> % & | ^ ~      bit operations (ints only)
   && || !              boolean operations
   == !=                equality comparisons
   >= <= < >            inequality comparisons

Stua "fixes" the precedence error in C's "&" and "|" operators; they
have higher precedence than comparisons do.

Also available is assignment, which can be written in either of these two ways:

   x = a
   let x = a

The other C assignment operators are not available. Assignments produce
values and 

The `&&` and `||` operators are short circuiting. They also
produce their arguments as results; for example, in `x``&&``y`, if x is
false then the result is x; if x is true then the result is y.
By default only boolean values have boolean meanings, so x must
be a boolean (although y need not be); otherwise an error is
thrown. However, you can overload the "conditional" operator
to introduce other semantics for non-booleans (e.g. everything
else being treated as true).

### Function calls

Function parameters can be declared as taking default values:

   func myfunc(widget, parameter, name="default name")
      ...
   end

Function calls can specify parameters by position or by name:

   x = myfunc(a, 2, "my thing")
   y = myfunc(a, 3, name="thing")
   z = myfunc(widget=a, 4)
   w = myfunc(parameter=5, a)

Functions can also be called using dictionaries for their
parameters lists, using ":" to call them; for example, the
first call above can also be written as:

   x = myfunc:{a, 2, "my thing"}

You can perform _partial application_ by using the "+" operator
instead of the ":" operator; this applies _named_ arguments to the
parameters but doesn't call the function; instead it returns
a "new" function. Each of the following is equivalent to the above:

   f2 = myfunc+{widget=a, name="my thing"}
   x = f2(5)

   f3 = myfunc+{widget=a}+{parameter=5}+{name="my thing"}
   x = f3()

   x = (myfunc+{widget=a, name="mything})(5)

However, there is no way to perform partial application by
position; it is only allowed by name.

Similarly, it is possible to introspect the current stack frame
by viewing it as a dictionary:

   func myfunc(widget, parameter, name="default name")
      var x = _frame
      print(x.widget)
      myotherfunc:x
      widget = 1
      x["widget"] = 5
      print(widget)  // not 5!
   end

This is useful for creating functions that accept variable
number of parameters. The parameters will be listed in
`\_frame` by integer values; the leftmost parameter is
parameter 0, the next is parameter 1, etc..

Nested functions can refer to lexically scoped variables
outside their own definition; closures will be created.

    func adder(z)
       func(x) z+x end  // lexical closure
    end
    var p = adder(5)
    print(p(2)) // prints 7
    print(p(3)) // prints 8

    func counter(z)
       func() z = z + 1 end
    end

    var c = counter(0)
    var d = counter(0)
    print(c())   // prints 1
    print(c())   // prints 2
    print(c())   // prints 3
    print(d())   // prints 1
    print(d())   // prints 2
    print(d())   // prints 3

## Language in detail

### Literals

#### Integers

Integer literals can be decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers
with a "0x" prefix, or single character constants. Character
constants consist of a single character in single quotes
preceded by the character 'c'.

    44      0x2C        c'+'     c'A'
    1000    0x0003e8    c'\n'    c'\t'

#### Floating point

Floating point literals are parsed as in C.

#### Strings

Strings appear as text inside single- or double-quoted strings.

### Identifiers

>  id    _id    a_very_long_identifier_52
>  id2   id_    tHiS_iS_aLsO_lEgItImAtE

Identifiers beginning with _ are reserved for use by the Stua.


### More on dictionaries

For the basic types, two items are identical if they have the same value. Integers and floating point numbers are identical in the appropriate cases.

Non-basic types are only identical based on reference. (For example,
two separately-created dictionaries with identical contents will still
be two distinct keys.)








## Details

### Floating point representation


Floating point numbers use a 31-bit variant of IEEE single-precision
floating point with 23 bits of mantissa and only 7 of exponent.
This representation exactly represents all numbers from 32-bit IEEE
as small as 10<sup>-19</sup> and as large as 10<sup>19</sup> without any loss.
Thus many floating point computations and algorithms will work unchanged;
for example, when normalizing a vector you could safely square a number
of magnitude as large as 10<sup>9</sup> without any loss.

## Rationale

### Why limitations on numbers?

Stua makes some concessions to achieving a high-performance
implementation. In particular, since everything is dynamically
typed, data items must carry along a type indicator. If we
want to store data items compactly when storing them in arrays
and such, we have to resort to boxing them (storing them somewhere
and keeping a pointer instead) or tagging (using some of the bits
in the data item to indicate a subset of the types).

Stua is designed to allow data items to be stored in 32 bits
with tags; there are two tag bits so four cases each with 30
bits; one case is ints, so ints are 30 bits; one case is a
pointer to all other types (fortunately 4-byte aligned
pointers don't use their bottom 2 bits anyway), and the other
two cases are both used to represent floating point numbers,
which therefore get 31 bits.

(Someday when stb.h is rewritten to support 64-bit compilation,
the "pointers" will become indices into a pointer table which
already exists.)

<h3>Floating point representation</h3>



Floating point numbers use a 31-bit variant of IEEE single-precision
floating point with 23 bits of mantissa and only 7 of exponent.
This representation exactly represents all numbers from 32-bit IEEE
as small as 10<sup>-19</sup> and as large as 10<sup>19</sup> without any loss.
Thus many floating point computations and algorithms will work unchanged;
for example, when normalizing a vector you could safely square a number
of magnitude as large as 10<sup>9</sup> without any loss.
<p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>


<h3>Why limitations on numbers?</h3>


Stua makes some concessions to achieving a high-performance
implementation. In particular, since everything is dynamically
typed, data items must carry along a type indicator. If we
want to store data items compactly when storing them in arrays
and such, we have to resort to boxing them (storing them somewhere
and keeping a pointer instead) or tagging (using some of the bits
in the data item to indicate a subset of the types).
<p>
Stua is designed to allow data items to be stored in 32 bits
with tags; there are two tag bits so four cases each with 30
bits; one case is ints, so ints are 30 bits; one case is a
pointer to all other types (fortunately 4-byte aligned
pointers don't use their bottom 2 bits anyway), and the other
two cases are both used to represent floating point numbers,
which therefore get 31 bits.
<p>
(Someday when stb.h is rewritten to support 64-bit compilation,
the "pointers" will become indices into a pointer table which
already exists.)
